Project Overview:
We are building Exvorta, an AI-powered export-import logistics platform designed to streamline the global trade process for beginner exporters and SMEs in Indonesia. Exvorta will provide end-to-end export lifecycle management, from product selection to buyer-supplier matchmaking, regulatory compliance, and shipment management, all integrated with AI. The platform must ensure real-time data integration, predictive insights, and seamless user experience for beginners.
